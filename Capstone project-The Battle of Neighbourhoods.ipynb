It is now the 24th most populous city in the world.\n\nBengaluru is the third wealthiest city in India according to a study.Bengaluru boasts of a total wealth of USD 320 billion. The city is a home to 7,500 millionaires and 8 billionaires.\n\nMillionaires or high net worth individuals (HNWIs) refer to individuals with net assets of USD 1 million or more. Billionaries refer to individuals with net asset of USD 1 billion or more.\n\nHNI's in Bengaluru prefer to invest in various investment products,real estate,digital currecy etc.,which gives huge oppurtunities to financial institutions like banks.\n\nLooking at the current situation most of these ultra HNI's will prefer to work from home. So opening bank branch in one of these residency area will provide bank more oppurtunites to onboard such coustomers and cross sell multiple banking products.\n\n\n"
