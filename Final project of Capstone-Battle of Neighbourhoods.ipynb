From IT staff to service staff, everybody benefits from tech parks.\n\nThere are numerous tech parks in every area of Bangalore that makes every area its own ecosystem with people living in the area without having to move to other parts of the city.\n\nBangalore likely has the most number of tech parks in a city compared to any other city in the country and it is truly the silicon valley of India. This is possible only because of its rich history in manufacturing with companies such as HAL and the founding of tech giants like Infosys.\n\nAs the current state of tech parks are feeling the pressure of unprecedented growth, it is highly likely that the current tech parks will be fully occupied in a matter of a few years.\n\nBangalore\u2019s growth potential is unlimited. With areas expanding across the city, there are opportunities for more builders to set-up big tech parks in other areas of Bangalore.\n\nIf Bangalore\u2019s infrastructure problems are fixed, then for the foreseeable future it is expected to retain the number one city for technology companies.\n\nSince the salary of the employees of the IT companies and IT enabled companies are on the higher side, hence it will help bank to acquire quality accounts and cross sale other banking products.\n\nTherefore opening bank branch near tech parks give wide business oppurtunity for that bank.\n"
